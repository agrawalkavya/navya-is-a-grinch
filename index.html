As the Editor-in-Chief of DTU Times, she's shown incredible leadership and dedication, but what stands out most is her genuine care for the people around her.</p>

                            <p class="magazine-text">Her passion for storytelling isn't just professional—it's personal. She remembers the little things, celebrates your wins as if they were her own, and has this infectious energy that makes even the most mundane moments feel special.</p>
                            
                            <p class="magazine-text">Whether it's late-night editing sessions, impromptu coffee runs, or those deep conversations that stretch into the early hours, Navya has a way of making every interaction meaningful. She's the friend who shows up—not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and with her whole heart.</p>

She pushes boundaries professionally while never losing sight of what matters most: the people in her life. Her editorial vision at DTU Times reflects this—stories that matter, voices that need to be heard, and a commitment to truth and authenticity.</p>
                            
                            <p class="magazine-text">But beyond the editor's desk, Navya is the friend who remembers your favorite coffee order, who texts you random memes at 2 AM, who celebrates your achievements louder than you do, and who's there with tissues and ice cream when things get tough.</p>
